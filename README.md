portland_fiber_huts
===================

Possible locations for [Google Fiber huts](http://comptechrt.blogspot.com/2013/10/google-fiber-beyond-cpe.html) (20x10ft distribution buildings) in Portland. These were [provided by the city](ftp://ftp02.portlandoregon.gov/CivicApps/cop_fiber_hut_cand_sts.zip), see also [this document](http://www.portlandoregon.gov/revenue/article/489315?).

The GIS files were [converted to a standard projection](https://github.com/tedder/portland_fiber_huts/pull/1) by [Mele Sax-Barnett](https://github.com/pdxmele). [Ted Timmons](https://github.com/tedder/) added pretty purple colors and removed the "not viable" entries.
